## Setup

1. Install the Zabbix agent 2 on your host.
2. Connect to the veeam sql server, adjust protocols for VEEAMSQL in "Sql Server Configuration Manager" for permit to connect with TCP/IP
3. With SQL Server Management Studio : Create User/Pass with reader rights , permit to connect with local user in sql settings and specify the default database. With sqlcmd.exe (Change password "CHANGEME" with something more secure):

    ```sql
    USE [VeeamBackup]
    CREATE LOGIN [zabbixveeam] WITH PASSWORD = N'CHANGEME', CHECK_POLICY = OFF, CHECK_EXPIRATION = OFF;
    CREATE USER [zabbixveeam] FOR LOGIN [zabbixveeam];
    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'zabbixveeam';
    GO
    ```

4. In script, ajust variables line 73 to 78 to match your configuration
5. Copy `zabbix_vbr_job.ps1` in the directory : `C:\Program Files\Zabbix Agent 2\scripts\` (create folder if not exist)
6. Add `UserParameter=veeam.info[*],powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Program Files\Zabbix Agent 2\scripts\zabbix_vbr_job.ps1" "$1"` in zabbix_agent2.conf  
7. Import Template_Veeam_Backup_And_Replication.yaml file into Zabbix.
8. Associate Template "VEEAM Backup and Replication" to the host.  
NOTE: When importing the new template version on an existing installation please check all "Delete missing", except "Template linkage", to make sure the old items are deleted

Ajust Zabbix Agent & Server/Proxy timeout for userparameter, you can use this powershell command to determine the execution time :

```powershell
(Measure-Command -Expression{ & "C:\Program Files\Zabbix Agent 2\scripts\zabbix_vbr_job.ps1" "StartJobs"}).TotalSeconds
```
